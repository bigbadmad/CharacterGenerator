# Character Generator (AD&D 2e)

A browser-based AD&D 2nd Edition character generator with ability score rollers and automatic class/race limits, saving throws, THAC0, and derived stat modifiers.

## Project layout

- `src/` TypeScript source split into small modules:
	- `types.ts` shared enums and interfaces
	- `data.ts` game tables and constants
	- `dice.ts` crypto-backed dice helpers
	- `generator.ts` main logic class
	- `main.ts` app bootstrap and DOM wiring
- `dist/` compiled ES modules output (generated by `tsc`)
- `index.html` loads `dist/main.js` via `<script type="module">`

No bundler is required; the browser loads native ES modules compiled by TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for running TypeScript compiler and optional dev server)

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Outputs will be written to `dist/`.

Optional clean build:

```
npm run build:clean
```

## Develop

Type-check and compile on save:

```
npm start
```

## Serve locally

Because `index.html` uses `<script type="module">`, open it over HTTP (not `file://`). You can use the included static server:

```
npm run serve
```

Then open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.

Alternatively, use VS Code Live Server.

## Notes

- Legacy `generator.ts` and `generator.js` at the repo root are kept for reference but not used. The live code is under `src/` and compiled to `dist/`.
- If you see a `dist/src/` folder, it's a leftover from older builds and can be removed (`npm run clean`).
